I"ˆ<p>For a big part of my life I was alone like never before and while I have people around me who love and care for me, sometimes I feel I have been alone for as long as I can remember. In my life, during some of the most difficult days there was an anonymous online journal that I found. It was a diary of a girl who was almost my age, possibly going through things that I could relate to. It kept me going. It was depressing, honest and real. It made me feel that I wasnâ€™t the only one. She once wrote a poem that really spoke to me. It wasnâ€™t until years later that I found the actual author of the poem. Here is a poem by Doroth Parker.</p>
