title:  "Selling the drama"
---

I was visiting my old blog after such a long time. It was depressing and beautiful. Where did I find those words to eloquently put forward my emotion? It feels so honest, blunt and poetic. I am afraid I have grown too "refined" with time. So listening to old songs reminding myself how it was. I vividly remember, how I felt on some of the days when I wrote those blogs. Hurt, dejected and lonely. It was probably a hard time, but it defined me and I doubt if anything ever will change me like that. 

Song of the day `Live - Selling the drama`. I look back at my past with more sympathy it deserves. I can see my flaws and I can see how pathetic I was. Everything I did, everything I felt. 

I am on my 5th glass of wine. It stopped being a "me time" a while back I suppose. Atleast I am still able to type and that is a saving grace. I think, few years before I hit my mid life crisis. So I was thinking I should write about something meaningful today instead of just venting out. So, I am going to attempt and pen down what I think about responsibilities.

I always thought that I was going to be the poster child. Always thought I was going to be able to pull the balance between the two lives that will emerge in front of me. In some of my deepest predicament, I realize and acknowledge that I have failed myself and people who looked up to me. Love killed the love. It is depressing, sad and unfortunate. But it is how it is. 

It is inevitable. Dedicating this post for the love you choose to strangle for the love you embrace. I know it is there, acknowledged or not.
