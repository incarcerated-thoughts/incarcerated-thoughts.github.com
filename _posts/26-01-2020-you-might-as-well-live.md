# You might as well live

For a big part of my life I was alone like never before and while I have people around me who love and care for me, sometimes I feel I have been alone for as long as I can remember. In my life, during some of the most difficult days there was an anonymous online journal that I found. It was a diary of a girl who was almost my age, possibly going through things that I could relate to. It kept me going. It was depressing, honest and real. It made me feel that I wasn't the only one. She once wrote a poem that really spoke to me. It wasn't until years later that I found the actual author of the poem. Here is a poem by Doroth Parker.  


```
Razors pain you;
Rivers are damp;
Acids stain you;
And drugs cause cramp.
Guns arenâ€™t lawful;
Nooses give;
Gas smells awful;
You might as well live.

- Dorothy Parker
```

Today has been incredibly hard. It is one of those days when you think you can't take it anymore, but the hits keep coming, from all the direction around me. And I am just lying down here, taking them one after the other. Then I read this poem and it gives me a bit of strength. It makes me hope that there is a night to this day and tomorrow will be different. So here is to a tomorrow that I am yet to see. This day wasn't perfect, and I know many more coming my way, won't be. But I hope that on all those days even if my strength fails me, my _hope_ doesn't. And for that hope, in as wierd way as possible, I am eternally thankful to Dorothy Parker. 

So long.
